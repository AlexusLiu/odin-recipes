    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (6 ounce) boneless New York strip steaks</li>
      <li>3 cups bourbon whiskey</li>
      <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>step 1</h4>

      Gently tenderize steaks with a meat mallet. With a sharp knife, lightly
      <br />
      score the meat on one side diagonally. Place steaks in a casserole
      dish,<br />
      scored side up, and pour bourbon over them. Rub the brown sugar evenly
      <br />
      over each steak. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours. <br />

    <p>Preheat grill to high heat, and lightly oil grate. <br /></p>

    <h4>step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Place the steaks on the hot grill, with the sugar side down. Let cook <br>
      until sugar has caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes, then flip steaks, and finish <br>
      cooking to desired doneness. <br>
